These schedules were created to test the bounds of binary format used for the 
Wildlife Acoustics scheduler settings format.


Software version: SM4 Configurator 1.3.1

They were created by Anthony Truskinger while working on EMU
and are licensed with the parent license for this repository.

The files try to maximize the diversity of values that can
exist to make reverse engineering of the PGM format easier.

It is not recommended that anyone ever use these schedules
on a real sensor!
