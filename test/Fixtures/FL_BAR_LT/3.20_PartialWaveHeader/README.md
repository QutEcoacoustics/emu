This file was produced by a sensor that also corrupted memory cards.
The file was recovered using generic recovery software - hence the name.

This file was `\harvest_56\Undara-National-Park-Dry-A_143\93\Reconstructed\Audio\wav\file000000.wav` from the A2O.

The firmware is 3.20, which was determined by inspecting the header of other recovered files.
There is no log.

This sample is included because our WAVE parser crashed for this input.
The harvester on the Acoustic Workbench depends on EMU and thus crashed as well.
