# Performance

EMU is meant to be fast!

Here are some case examples!

### Extracting metadata from SM4 BAT recordings

Four SM4 BAT sensors were deployed and configured to activate with a noise threshold.

31,998 files were scanned with EMU and metadata extracted into a CSV in 1,095 seconds on a government laptop.

The average processing time per file was 34 milliseconds!
The resulting CSV included durations of recordings (variable for intensity triggered files), sensor serial numbers,
and location information.
