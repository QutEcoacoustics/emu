Wildlife Acoustics, Inc. is pleased to offer this header file describing our
proprietary meta data format encapsulated in WAV files produced by some of
our bioacoustics recorders including (with the latest firmware) the SM2,
SM2+, SM2BAT192x2, SM2BAT384, SM2BAT+, SM3, SM3BAT, EM3, EM3+ and 
Echo Meter Touch.

Our objective is to give our customers and third-party developers the ability
to decode our WAV files and create value-added solutions.

We hope you find this useful!
